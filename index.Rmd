I was formally trained as an epidemiologist at the [Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/).

I am primarily interested in studying treatment availability and delivery for substance use disorders. My current work examines the role of area-level factors in buprenorphine provider prevalence. 

I am also interested in the use of GIS and spatial statistics in epidemiologic investigations. 

At [the Open Case Studies project](https://opencasestudies.github.io/), I create case studies that showcase data analysis and visualization in the R programming environment.

I am currently looking for a position in an epidemiologist or data analyst role in the [Seattle Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_metropolitan_area?oldformat=true).

Feel free to contact me using one of the icons below.
